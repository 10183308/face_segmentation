## Overview
This project provides an interface for face segmentation using Caffe with a fully connected convolutional neural network.
The network was trained on IARPA Janus CS2 dataset (excluding subjects that are also in [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)) using a novel process for collecting ground truth face segmentations, inlvolving our tool for [semi-supervised Face video segmentation](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/face_video_segment). Additional synthetic images were generated by augmenting hands from the [EgoHands dataset](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/egohands/), and augmenting 3D models of glasses and microphones.

## Installation
- Use CMake and your favorite compiler to build and install the library.
- Download the [face_seg_fcn8s.zip](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/face_segmentation/releases/download/0.9/face_seg_fcn8s.zip) and extract to "data" in the installation directory.
- Add "bin" in the installation directory to path.

## Usage
- For using the library's C++ interface, please take a look at the [Doxygen generated documentation](https://yuvalnirkin.github.io/face_segmentation/).
- For python go to "interfaces/python" in the installation directory and run:
```DOS .bat
python face_seg.py
```
